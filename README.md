# PkmnCalcWPF
WPF MVVM app created as a way to learn WPF. This app shows damage multipliers that affect defending pokemon.  
After selecting types and hitting the `Show damage taken` button it displays every possible attacking pokemon type and
a multiplier of its damage. The list of multipliers and types is sorted by the dmg multiplier from highest to lowest by default.  
There are 4 ways of sorting available:
by the `Type` alphabetically (ascending and descending) and by the `Damage multiplier` value (ascending and descending).
